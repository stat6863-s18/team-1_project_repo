Note:  We would be looking at data for the 2014-15 NBA season in the
players_stats_data dataset using the "Name", "FG_PCT", and "FGA" columns along
with the players_stats_1516_data dataset using the columns "Player",  "FG_PCT",
and "FGA".

Limitations:  Since we are comparing data over a two year period, we can not
exactly conclude much as far as whether there is a trend from the small
timeline.

Methodology:  We will use proc sort to order the data by FG_PCT in descending
order, provided that the players selected shot more than 10 field goals per
game.  We then use proc report to display a table of the top ten leaders in the
field goal percentage category while indicating which columns we wish output.
Finally, we use proc sgplot to display these ten leaders and how their
respective field goal percentage for the indicated season compares with the
other leaders.

Followup Steps:  We could follow up this experiment by expanding our data to
include the player's position to see if there is a corrlation between a
player's field goal percentage compared to their natural position.

;

footnote2 justify=left
"A possible reason for the decline in shooting percentage among leaders is that games are being played faster, which leads to more shots, and therefore a higher chance of rushed shots being missed."

'Question: Who are the NBA players that averaged the most assists during the 2014-15 and 2015-2015 season?'
;

title2 justify=left
'Rationale:  Ball movement has become more recognized and utilized in recent years, so it would be important to know which players produce the most assists over the duration of a season and if they can be consistent in doing it the following season.'
;

*
Note:  We will be using the players_stats_data dataset with the columns "Name"
and "AST", and the players_stats_data_raw_1516 dataset for this analysis while
using the columns "Player" and "AST".  Due to the data in each dataset being a
year apart, some players may not be on the same team in both datasets

Limitations:  Given how the data for the players_stats_data dataset displays
total stats for the season and the players_stats_data_raw_1516 displays stats
per game, we do not have an exact comparison.  We would need to multiply or
divide one of the datasets by 83, the number of games in an NBA season, in
order to have an exact comparison

Methoology:  We use proc sql to create a table while computing the average
number of assists per game over the two seasons for each player.  The table is
sorted in descending order by this category as we display the top ten leaders
for average assists.

Followup steps:  We can include more columns to further advance any analysis
that we wish to experiment on that can relate to player's assists, such as
Team, Position, and Points.

'Question: What is a larger factor for NBA players grabbing the most rebounds:  Height or Weight?'
;

title2 justify=left
'Rationale: It will be interesting to analyze whether height or weight is a larger factor towards producing more rebounds.  General managers of teams could use this analysis when determining which future NBA players to draft to the team.'
;

*
Note:  We will be using the columns "Name" and "REB" from the
players_stats_data dataset along with the columns "HEIGHT_SHOES" and "WEIGHT" in
the nba_combine_anthro dataset

Limitations:  Since the player list for the player_anthro data is only showing
heights and weights for players from the NBA combine, the comparision may not
have complete accuracy given the typical height and weight of an NBA player is
much different than one about to enter the league

Methodology:  Use proc corr to give us the overall average in HEIGHT_SHOES and
WEIGHT for all NBA players in our dataset, with no missing data included.
Then, use proc sort to order the dataset by Rebounds in descending order while
indicating HEIGHT_SHOES and WEIGHT are greater than zero.  We then use proc
report to create a table while indicating the columns we want to be displayed.
Finally, we use proc means to compute the two averages in HEIGHT_SHOES and
WEIGHT among the top twenty rebounders according to the table.

Followup Steps:  Cleaning out any unecessary information under the proc corr
table in order to make the analysis easier to comprehend and conclude.
